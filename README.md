## jargot


The __jargot__ is a portmanteau word. A combination of _json_, [JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/), and [_argot_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argot); it's pronounced, _järɡō_.  Simply, _jargot_ is an implementation of the [Kernel](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html) programming language. JSON is the initial _jargot's_ initial concrete syntax. That is, instead of using [s-expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) as in other Lisp-like language, _jargot_ uses JSON.
